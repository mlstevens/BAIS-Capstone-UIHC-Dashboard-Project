# BAIS-Capstone-UIHC-Dashboard-Project
A group project that was a semester-long project that had a goal of helping the hospital's chief analytical team get a fresh set of eyes on lowering theor length of stay issue, which is very important.
The end goal was to highlight 6 problem areas that we found that we thought the team should investigate further. The final project was in the form of 6 graphs and tables that can be used by all hospital staff
